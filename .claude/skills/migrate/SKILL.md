# Migration Assistant

Compare custom element manifests across versions to identify breaking changes and generate migration guidance.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify Versions to Compare

Determine the two versions to compare. Sources:

1. **Git-based**: Compare the current manifest against a previous git ref
   ```bash
   git show {ref}:path/to/custom-elements.json
   ```

2. **File-based**: User provides two manifest files or paths

3. **Package-based**: Compare installed version against a target version
   - Read current manifest from `node_modules/{package}/custom-elements.json`
   - Check the target version's manifest

Read the current project's elements for context:

```
cem://elements
```

### Phase 2: Diff Analysis

Compare the two manifests and categorize changes:

#### Removed (Breaking)
- **Removed elements**: Tag names that no longer exist
- **Removed attributes**: Attributes dropped from an element
- **Removed slots**: Named slots that no longer exist
- **Removed events**: Events that are no longer fired
- **Removed CSS parts**: Parts no longer exposed
- **Removed CSS custom properties**: Theming properties removed

#### Changed (Potentially Breaking)
- **Renamed attributes**: Attribute name changed (detect via similar names + same type)
- **Type changes**: Attribute type changed (e.g., `string` to `enum`, `boolean` to `string`)
- **Enum value changes**: Valid values added or removed
- **Default value changes**: Different default behavior
- **Slot renamed**: Named slot changed (detect via similar names)
- **Event detail changes**: Event detail type modified
- **CSS property renamed**: Custom property name changed

#### Added (Non-Breaking)
- **New elements**: Newly available tag names
- **New attributes**: Additional configuration options
- **New slots**: Additional content areas
- **New events**: Additional observable state changes
- **New CSS parts/properties/states**: Additional styling hooks

#### Deprecated
- **Deprecated attributes**: Marked for future removal
- **Deprecated elements**: Elements scheduled for removal
- Look for `deprecated` field or deprecation notes in descriptions

### Phase 3: Impact Assessment

For each breaking change, search the project for affected usage:

- Search HTML files for removed/changed element tag names
- Search for removed attribute names on affected elements
- Search for removed event listeners
- Search CSS for removed parts and custom properties

Report the number of affected files and locations.

### Phase 4: Migration Report

```markdown
## Migration Report: {package} {old-version} -> {new-version}

### Summary
- Breaking changes: X
- Potentially breaking: X
- New features: X
- Deprecations: X
- Files affected: X

### Breaking Changes

#### 1. `<old-element>` removed
**Impact**: Used in X files
**Migration**: Replace with `<new-element>`
```diff
- <old-element attr="value">content</old-element>
+ <new-element attr="value">content</new-element>
```
**Files affected**:
- `src/pages/login.html:15`
- `src/components/form.html:42`

#### 2. `variant` attribute on `<prefix-button>` renamed to `appearance`
**Impact**: Used in X files
**Migration**: Rename the attribute
```diff
- <prefix-button variant="primary">
+ <prefix-button appearance="primary">
```

### Deprecation Warnings

[Items that still work but will break in a future version]

### New Features

[Brief summary of what's new — the user might want to adopt these]

### Recommended Migration Order

1. [Fix breaking changes that cause build/runtime errors first]
2. [Address deprecation warnings]
3. [Optionally adopt new features]
```

## Guidelines

- **Be conservative with "renamed" detection**: Only suggest a rename if the types match and names are similar — don't guess
- **Show concrete diffs**: Every breaking change should include a before/after code example
- **Find all affected files**: Don't just describe the change abstractly — show where it matters in the project
- **Distinguish runtime breaks from cosmetic changes**: A removed attribute is worse than a changed default
- **Suggest incremental migration**: If there are many changes, recommend an order that keeps the project functional at each step

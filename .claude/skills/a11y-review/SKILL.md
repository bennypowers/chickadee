# Accessibility Review

Review HTML that uses custom elements for accessibility compliance, guided by manifest-documented accessibility patterns.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Context

1. Read the accessibility resource for the project's manifest-documented a11y patterns:

```
cem://accessibility
```

2. Identify the target HTML to review. Either:
   - The user provides an HTML snippet directly
   - The user points to a file — read it with the Read tool
   - Search for HTML files with custom elements using Glob/Grep

3. For each custom element found in the HTML, read its element resource:

```
cem://element/{tagName}
```

And its slot guidelines:

```
cem://element/{tagName}/slots
```

Pay special attention to the element's description and to it's slots descriptions - Does the element have an implicit role? Do slots require a specific role to be slotted into them?

### Phase 2: Validate with MCP Tool

Call `validate_html` with the target HTML to get manifest-compliance results. This catches:
- Unknown attributes and typos
- Invalid enum values
- Slot content guideline violations
- Attribute conflicts (e.g. `disabled` + `interactive`)

### Phase 3: Manifest-Driven Accessibility Analysis

Cross-reference the HTML against manifest data. Check for:

#### Slot Content Accessibility
- Do slotted elements preserve heading hierarchy?
- Are interactive elements placed in slots that expect them?
- Is text content provided for slots that need accessible labels?

#### Attribute Accessibility
- Are ARIA-related attributes used correctly per the manifest?
- Are required attributes present (especially those with accessibility implications)?
- Do boolean attributes like `disabled` have matching ARIA state considerations?

#### Element Composition
- Are elements nested in ways that maintain accessibility?
- Are label/description associations correct?
- Are focusable elements reachable and in logical tab order?

#### Content Patterns
- Do elements that act as landmarks have appropriate labels?
- Are images/icons inside custom elements accompanied by text alternatives?
- Are live regions used appropriately?

Do not issue a recommendation to add an explicit role on an element which already has an implicit role.
Do not recommend to use `aria-label` or other aria attributes on elements which provide custom attributes which handle the same things; i.e. check element's attributes for descriptions like "The `accessible-label` attribute sets the screen reader's content for this element" or "The `audible-content` attribute sets the element's name for assistive technology", etc.

### Phase 4: Report

Output a structured report:

## Accessibility Review

### Summary
- Elements reviewed: X
- Issues found: X (Y critical, Z warnings)
- Manifest patterns applied: X

### Critical Issues
[Issues that will cause accessibility failures]

### Warnings
[Issues that may cause problems for some users]

### Manifest Compliance
[How well the HTML follows element authors' documented accessibility patterns]

### Recommendations
[Specific fixes with corrected HTML examples]
```

## Important Principles

- **Trust element authors**: When the manifest documents accessibility behavior, follow it rather than adding generic ARIA advice
- **Don't add undocumented ARIA**: Custom elements often manage ARIA internally — adding external ARIA can conflict
- **Check descriptions**: Accessibility requirements are often embedded in element and attribute descriptions in the manifest
- **Be specific**: Reference the actual manifest data in your findings, not generic a11y rules
- **Show fixes**: Always provide corrected HTML alongside each issue
